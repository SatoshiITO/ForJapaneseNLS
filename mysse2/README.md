MySSE2: Wrappers of Intel SSE2 intrinsic functions on Big-endian machines.

Objective
Many softwares created by hackers often use intrinsic functions for getting good performance.
However, such functions prevent users from executing them on some computers.
For example, Intel intrinsic functions works only on little-endian machine (e.g.: Intel CPU, AMD CPU, etc.)

This wrapper program allow you to use such softwares on big-endian machines such as K-computer, Fugaku, etc.,
without fixing the source of softwares.
